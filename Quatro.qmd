## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Adding Code
Below is an R code chunk that calculates the sum of 2 and 3.

```{r}
2 + 3

hist(rnorm(100))

knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/LATITUDE5520/Documents/GIT/Deliverable/Quatro_files")

```{r}
# Load ggplot2 for plotting
library(ggplot2)

# Scatter plot
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue", size = 3) +  # Adds points
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red") +  # Adds a trend line
  labs(title = "Horsepower vs MPG",
       x = "Horsepower (hp)",
       y = "Miles per Gallon (mpg)") +
  theme_minimal()

```

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
